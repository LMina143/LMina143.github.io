### CPSC 120

* **Lab 4, Part 2 – High/Low Guessing Game**

    Lab 4, part two was one of my favorites because it was the first time I had to design the logic of a program completely on my own. Instead of being given step-by-step instructions, I needed to figure out how the if-statements should flow and how to compare guesses to the secret number. This helped me practice problem-solving and debugging, and it showed me how even a simple game can require clear planning. I enjoyed seeing the game come together and watching how the hints—“too high” or “too low”—made the program feel interactive.

* **Lab 6, Part 2 – Blackjack Scoring**

    Lab 6, part two stood out to me because it made me think carefully about how real-world rules get translated into program logic. Figuring out how to score the cards, especially handling the ace bonus, required attention to detail and good use of conditional statements. I liked learning how different combinations of cards can change the score, and how the program had to consider multiple possibilities to avoid a bust. This lab helped me understand functions and decision-making in code more deeply, and it was satisfying to see the program correctly score many different hands.

* **Lab 10, Part 2 – State Demographics and Population Density**

    Lab 10, part two was a favorite because it was my first experience working with real data from a CSV file. I learned how to store the information using a vector of vectors and how to loop through the data to compute useful statistics. Calculating population density and finding the highest and lowest values made me think more about algorithms and how to organize data in a meaningful way. It felt rewarding to see the program produce real-world information, and it helped me build confidence in using vectors and multiple source files.
